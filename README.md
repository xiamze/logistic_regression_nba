# Logistic Regression And Regularization Research

This project applied Logistic Regression from sklearn to conduct a classification problem. Based on the NBA game data, train a model to judge whether a set of game data (2P/3P/AST etc.) belongs to Kobe. Model reached prediction accuracy of 75%. An extensive research of how regularization level effects model parameters is conducted based on different regularization level and mathmatical interval.

此项目为使用sklearn库的Logistic Regression创建的分类模型。基于NBA历年数据，训练模型用于判断一组数据集（二分球/三分球/助攻等）是否属于科比，模型预测准确率达到75%。此外，基于不同的正则化方法与数学区间，探究了正则化对模型参数产生的约束效果。
