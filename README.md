# logistic_regression_regularization

This project applied Logistic Regression from sklearn to conduct a classification problem. Based on the NBA game data, train a model to judge whether a set of game data (2P/3P/AST/FG etc.) belongs to Kobe. An extensive research of how regularization level effects model parameters is conducted based on different regularization level and mathmatical interval.

More about the model in logistic_regression.ipynb.
